# Utilities

A series of libraries which are useful in the construction.

## Nomenclature

All the libraries are named after characters from Shakespeare plays (the names are not supposed to
be chosen at random but instead to in some way reflect, maybe a little bit, the functions that the
libraries serve – though I'm sure that this has not been a successful endeavour).
