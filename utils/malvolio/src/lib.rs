//! # Start here
//!
//! Malvolio is a library for writing declarative, strongly-typed HTML. If you've come accross the
//! "builder pattern" that's what, at its essence, this library is. While there are many excellent
//! (and thoughtful) approaches people have developed for producing HTML code inside of Rust
//! programs, we think Malvolio is somewhat unique because it tries its best to integrate HTML
//! inside of the confines of the language and resists jumping out the macro "escape hatch".
//!
//! Malvolio is "isomorphic" (you can use it both on servers and in browsers – Malvilio integrates
//! with Yew in order to work inside browsers). If you'd like to use Yew, you'll need to activate
//! the "with_yew" feature. If you activate the "with_rocket" feature, the `Responder` trait is
//! implemented for `Html`, so you can return `Html` directly from your routes.
//!
//! Although in early stages, Malvolio works and is suitable (we think) for general use. Do note,
//! however, that there might be breaking API changes (but we aren't currently planning any :D).
//!
//! # Safety
//!
//! Malvolio uses no unsafe code
//!
//! # Crate structure
//!
//! Most of the important things are re-exported from `prelude`. If you're burning to try Malvolio
//! out, just add `use malvolio::prelude::*;` which will import all the HTML tags that Malvolio
//! supports and you should be good to go! If you run into problems feel free to reach out for help.
//! The best place to do this at the moment is the Yew Discord server (a link to this can be found
//! on the [Yew website](https://yew.rs))
//!
//! Note that although Malvolio *should* support all the HTML specification, it might not
//! – if we're missing a tag please let us know! (A great contribution opportunity :D). We want to
//! support the full spec, but we might have missed something (we've all been there, and if we
//! haven't, then we will be :D)
//!
//! Internally, most things are in the `tag` module, although some common attributes are in the
//! `attributes` module. Some extra items which are only available when the "with_yew" feature is
//! enabled can be found in the `comp` and `into_vnode` modules.
//!
//! # CSS support
//!
//! Malvolio supports standard CSS things (classes, style attributes), but if you're looking for a
//! "rust in css" style solution (which allows you to write your CSS using Rust) have a look at a
//! library we maintain for doing this called [Mercutio](https://docs.rs/mercutio).
//!
//! # UI library
//!
//! This may or may not work for you, but we also maintain a UI library called Portia (I know,
//! so many Shakespearian characters :D) that has a (we think, but if you don't think, please give
//! feedback :D) nice set of abstractions that make it easier to write user interfaces more easily.
//!
//! # Contributing
//!
//! We welcome contributions, issues, concerns and suggestions (if you just want to chat, join us in
//! the #malvolio channel on the [Yew Discord server](https://discord.gg/VQck8X4))! Malvolio's
//! source code is located in the `utils/malvolio` directory of the
//! [Lovelace repository](https://github.com/lovelace-ed/lovelace). We're happy to mentor new
//! contributors if they need help.
