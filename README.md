# Lovelace

A computer system designed to get out of your way (when you want it to) and let you get on with
education.

## Features
- **Fast** (should be at least, let us know if you're experiencing issues!)
- **No** crazy page load sizes (e.g. we won't send you the same amount of data as Pride and
Prejudice contains if you ask for a list of your lessons today).
- **Community-driven** – this isn't the plaything of a venture capitalist. This is free (as in
freedom) software that anyone can contribute to, modify and run.
- **Accessible** – the platform is designed to be usable by everyone. We're working to try and


## Contributions

No platform for education can be meaningful if its users are powerless to change it. We welcome all
contributors. To make this as friendly as possible:
- We have produced a document (see `CONTRIBUTING.md`) which explains the process of contributing to
Lovelace. Hopefully the doucment explains things clearly. If it doesn't though, **it's not a you**
**problem, it's an us problem**. Please let us know and we can update the document so that future
readers don't get tripped up by the same problem :D

IMPORTANT: Remember, if you think that you're "not a programmer" or "not skilled enough to
contribute" then you are **exactly** the sort of person who should be contributing. Sure, everyone
runs into problems (and often kick themselves, figuratively speaking of course, when they realise
that it was just a missing bracket) but that's not a reason to give up. We're always happy to try
and help each other solve issues – if you get stuck, don't hesitate to reach out!
