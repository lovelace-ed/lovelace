# Project architecture

## The crucial consideration(s)

Before building anything, consider:

> How can it be made usable?

This seems simple – deceptively so. Inside this seemingly simple question lurks another
consideration:

> Usable for whom?

Which matters. Matters a lot. Does it "work" on a "budget" smartphone running on a 12kb/s internet
connection, possibly hundreds of miles away from the nearest server? Does it work for people who
have vision impairments? Is it more intuitive for some users than others – meaning that they can get
ahead while others are held back, by the stuff that we build?
