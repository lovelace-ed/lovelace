# Documentation

The worst sort of code is the kind where you are adrift at sea with no hope of rescue (that is, code
without documentation). We'd like to avoid this happening, so in order to do this we ensure that all
code in the project is clearly documented.

## Methodology

Documentation is always on a best-efforts basis. This isn't to say that it's unimportant – this is
to say that we realise that there can never be enough (or good enough) documentation. Documentation
can always better. At its heart documentation is not only a technical measure for producing
so-called "good" (or "clean" or "beautiful" or any other similar remark) code, but is about ensuring
accessiblity and equity.

We document code to ensure that more people are able to work on it. We document code because it
gives people who might otherwise lack it the confidence to press on, aware that those who have
worked on this code before them *wanted* them to read and understand it, to be able to modify it;
this because why write crisp, coherent instructions for somebody else other than to invite them in
to participate and join you in your endeavour – through documentation it is no longer just "your"
endeavour, instead it becomes "our" endeavour, a collective one.

Documentation should be written for:
1. Processes – including:
    * How we decide whose code is accepted and whose is rejected.
    * Project structure (how, when and why people are given write access)
    * Determining project direction (how to submit proposals, how we gage community interest)
2. Code that we maintain – including:
    * API documentation (for end users of the code)
    * Documentation of code internals (for people working on the code)

## Process

If something isn't clear to you – ask! Ask until the end of the earth. Nobody's going to be rude or
impolite (no matter how many questions you ask). We might not have time to answer them immediately,
but we'll always be nice – we promise we don't bite :D
